    # The lock file generator uses a layer from the Dockerfile to determine the base image.
    # Then it includes all the RPM packages that are needed to install the packages from this file including its dependencies.
    # We use the target-base which is ubi-micro. The ubi-micro has fewer installed RPMs therefore the lock file is larger than for ubi-minimal.
